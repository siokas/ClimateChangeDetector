It applies to specialized digital module, and collects technology and humidity & temperature sensor technology. All of this can guarantee the product with extremely high reliability and excellent long-term stability.\r\n\r\nThis sensor contains one resistance type moisture element and one NTC temperature-testing component, which connected to high-performance 8 pro SCM. Therefore, there are so many advantages below: high quality and excellent, extremely fast response, high antijamming capability. For each DHT11 sensor, it can calibrate in the extremely exact temperature check room. The calibration factor is stored in the OTP RAM in the form of procedural. When it tests processing of the signal inside the sensor, it needs to call the calibration factor. The single wire system port makes the system intergration simplier and faster. The excellent advantage like extreme minimum volume and ultralow energy consumption and the signal transmission distance up 20m or above, makes it become the best choice even under harshest application environment. Variously.\r\n\r\nIt is 4 pin single row package. Convenient connecting, if you need the special package type, we can customize it per your requirement.\r\n\r\n[Link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2pcs-DHT11-Digital-Humidity-Temperature-Sensor-DHT11-NEW-/121347042442?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c40d8ec8a)\r\n\r\n### Photo Resistor\r\n![Photoresistor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solotsopa/ClimateChangeDetector/master/ClimateChangeDetector/images/photoresistor1.jpg)\r\n<br><br>\r\nPhotoresistors are sensors that allow you to detect light. They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. For that reason they often appear in toys, gadgets and appliances. They are often referred to as CdS cells (they are made of Cadmium-Sulfide), light-dependent resistors (LDR), and photoresistors. Photocells are basically a resistor that changes its resistive value (in ohms Ω) depending on how much light is shining onto the squiggly face. They are very low cost, easy to get in many sizes and specifications, but are very innacurate. Each photocell sensor will act a little differently than the other, even if they are from the same batch. The variations can be really large, 50% or higher! For this reason, they shouldn't be used to try to determine precise light levels in lux or millicandela. Instead, you can expect to only be able to determine basic light changes.\r\n\r\n[Link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/KY-018-photoresistor-module-for-Arduino-AVR-PIC-/121167420768?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c36241d60)\r\n\r\n### About Code\r\nThe code is targeted for the Arduino Yún and Arduino IDE 1.5.6-r2. \r\n* It includes two header files (the DHT.h file is provided)<br>\r\n`#include <FileIO.h>`<br>\r\n`#include \"DHT.h\"`<br>\r\n* You have to define the DHT pin that you have connected the Humidity-Temperature sensor and the type of your module.<br>\r\n`#define DHTPIN 2`<br>\r\n`#define DHTTYPE DHT11`<br>\r\n* Initialise everything that you need to<br>\r\n`Bridge.begin();`<br>\r\n`Serial.begin(9600);`<br>\r\n`FileSystem.begin();`<br>\r\n`dht.begin();`<br>\r\n* Read all analog values in a for loop and save them in a string variable<br>\r\n`for (int analogPin = 0; analogPin < 3; analogPin++) {`<br>\r\n    `int sensor = analogRead(analogPin);`<br>\r\n    `dataString += String(sensor);`<br>\r\n    `if (analogPin < 2) {`<br>\r\n      `dataString += \",\";`<br>\r\n    `}`<br>\r\n  `}`<br>\r\n* Write the values in a txt file in the SD card <br>\r\n`File dataFile = FileSystem.open(\"/mnt/sd/datalog.txt\", FILE_APPEND);`<br>\r\n  `if (dataFile) {`<br>\r\n    `dataFile.println(dataString);`<br>\r\n    `dataFile.close();`<br>\r\n  `}`<br>\r\n* The .txt file should look like this<br>\r\n`05/22/14-16:44:20 = 979,979,465,59.00,27.00`<br>\r\n`05/22/14-16:44:26 = 970,560,477,58.00,27.00`<br>\r\n`05/22/14-16:44:32 = 979,560,469,58.00,27.00`<br>\r\n`05/22/14-16:44:37 = 330,560,450,58.00,27.00`<br>\r\n`05/22/14-16:44:43 = 329,562,456,58.00,27.00`<br>\r\n`05/22/14-16:44:49 = 328,563,456,58.00,27.00`<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### About Climate Change\r\nClimate is usually defined as the “average weather” in a place. It includes patterns of temperature, precipitation (rain or snow), humidity, wind and seasons. Climate patterns play a fundamental role in shaping natural ecosystems, and the human economies and cultures that depend on them. But the climate we’ve come to expect is not what it used to be, because the past is no longer a reliable predictor of the future. Our climate is rapidly changing with disruptive impacts, and that change is progressing faster than any seen in the last 2,000 years. Because so many systems are tied to climate, a change in climate can affect many related aspects of where and how people, plants and animals live, such as food production, availability and use of water, and health risks. For example, a change in the usual timing of rains or temperatures can affect when plants bloom and set fruit, when insects hatch or when streams are their fullest. This can affect historically synchronized pollination of crops, food for migrating birds, spawning of fish, water supplies for drinking and irrigation, forest health, and more.Some short-term climate variation is normal, but longer-term trends now indicate a changing climate.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe device and the code are created from @solotsopa (Apostolos Siokas)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
